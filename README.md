# wind_turbines_and_playas
repository for data on our project identifying which playas are in close proximity to wind turbines

Repository includes GIS layers of playa basins (from the Playa Lakes Joint Venture), Christmas Bird Count circles (National Audubon Society), Breeding Bird Survey routes (USGS), and wind turbine and associated ancillary structure locations (Federal Aviation Administration).

An R script was built to query the CBC bird data from http://netapp.audubon.org/cbcobservation/, click on Current Year, and Count by Species. Designate the year and species for which you are collecting data, and save. This was done to compile data for Sandhill Crane, Northern Shoveler, and Northern Pintail from the years 1984 to 2016 (for example, Year "1984", Species "Sandhill Crane").
